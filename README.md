This projects evaluates the performance of the cruise control of a car (how good it keeps a constant vehicle speed) using
sensor data recorded by a mobile phone. The mobile phone was placed inside the car while driving on a road when the cruise control
was set to 70 km/h. The log file from the mobile phone consists of data from a GPS sensor and an IMU. I used state estimation kalman
filter to estimate the speed of a car using collected sensor data.
